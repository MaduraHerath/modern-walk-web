# Modern Walk – Frontend Prototype

This is the prototype implementation of **Modern Walk**, a modern and responsive fashion retail web application. The prototype is designed for UI/UX evaluation before the development phase.


> **Disclaimer:** _Since this is a prototype requiring rapid implementation, I prioritized delivering core functionality efficiently. As such, I have not integrated a state management library or written unit tests for this assignment._
